# Responsive-Portfolio

Assignment 2

The purpose of this activity was to enhance the Basic-Portfolio (created in the last unit) with a mobile-responsive layout using media queries.

# Important Points

* Having a reset.css file taken from https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/ skews the elements on my page so I have 'commented out' the link to this file. The reset file was added after I built the pages so I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it but it is defintely an area to look into further.

* The code foundation set in Basic-Portfolio combines a section header with a nav element. As a result, mobile-responsiveness is not very good where the header is concered but seems to work for the rest of the page!
